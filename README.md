This a complex analysis application to building data points for space-filling curves.  

The data constructed is all complex numbers and while the real and imaginary parts are simple plotted like (x,y) ordered pairs in the plane.  

The hilbert_curve_1.py file will print the first five iterations of Hilbert's space-filling curve with all five iterations layered on top of one another.  

The triangular_curves.py file plays with a different set of complex valued functions and utilized some of the geometric aspects of complex analysis to create various graphs and plots them the same way as the Hilbert curve.  

All plotting is done with matplotlib, however I also wanted to use the online tools at Plotly, so I used their Python API to utilize their online tools. The code has both plotting methods implemented, so make sure to comment out the correct bit of code according to how you want to plot the visualizations.
